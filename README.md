## Landing pages

The landing pages are generated by
[Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To install it locally:

    gem install jekyll

To preview the website locally from a working copy:

    jekyll serve

Then go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

Layouts are in the **_layouts** directory.

News are in the **_posts** directory.

SDK Releases Downloads are in the **_includes/releases** directory.

Only the news are in the Markdown format, the other pages that should rarely
change are plain HTML so we can fine-control the layout.

A news feed is built in **atom.xml** and the site map in **sitemap.txt**

Jekyll generate the website output in the **_site** directory that is added
in the **.gitignore** file.

## Versioned documentation

The versioned documentation is generated from
[asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc) text files from the Qi4j SDK
[source repository](http://qi4j.org/community/codebase.html) by the Qi4j
[build system](http://qi4j.org/latest/build-system.html).

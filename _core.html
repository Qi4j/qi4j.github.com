</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Composites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_composites"></a>Composites</h5></div></div></div><p>There are 4 Composite meta types. Each of these have very different characteristics and it is important to understand
these, so the right meta type is used for the right purpose.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
Entity - Classic meaning. Has an Identity. Is persistable and can be referenced by the Identity. Can act as
      Aggregate. Entity supports Lifecycle interface. Equals is defined by the Identity.
</li><li class="listitem">
Value - Values are persistable when used in a Property from an Entity. Values are immutable, and equals is
      defined by the values of its fields.
</li><li class="listitem">
Service - Service is injectable to other composites and java objects. They are not persistable, but if
      referenced from an Entity or Value, a new reference to the Service will be injected when the Entity/Value is
      deserialized. Services are singletons. There are <span class="emphasis"><em>hosted</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>imported</em></span> Services. The <span class="emphasis"><em>hosted</em></span> Service has
      Configuration and its life cycle controlled by the Qi4j runtime, whereas the <span class="emphasis"><em>imported</em></span> Services are external
      references.
</li><li class="listitem">
Transient - Short-lived composites that are not persistable. Equals/hashCode/toString are forwarded to the
      Mixin Type declaring those methods explicitly.
</li></ul></div><p>In versions of Qi4j prior to 2.0, composite types had to extend one of these 4 meta types, but in 2.0 and later, the
meta type interface is added dynamically during <a class="xref" href="core-bootstrap-assembly.html" title="Core Bootstrap">Assembly</a>.
We can therefor get rid of a lot of additional types, and use Qi4j-free interfaces directly;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@Mixins({BalanceCheckMixin.class, .... } )
public interface BankAccount

    Money checkBalance();
    :
    :
}</pre><p>and declare it with;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">public void assemble( ModuleAssembly module )
{
    module.entities( BankAccount.class );
}</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Structure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-structure"></a>Structure</h4></div></div></div><p>Qi4j promotes a conventional view of application structure, that computer science has been using for decades.</p><p>The definition is as follows;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
One Application per Qi4j runtime instance.
</li><li class="listitem">
One or more Layers per Application.
</li><li class="listitem">
Zero, one or more Modules per Layer.
</li><li class="listitem">
Zero, one or more Assemblies per Module.
</li></ul></div><p>The principle of this Structure is to assist the programmer to create well modularized applications, that are easily
extended and maintained. Qi4j will restrict access between Modules, so that code can only reach Composites and Objects
in Modules (including itself) of the same or lower Layers.</p><p>Each Layer has to be declared which lower Layer(s) it uses, and it is not allowed that a lower Layer uses a higher
Layer, i.e. cyclic references.</p></div><div class="section" title="ValueComposite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-value"></a>ValueComposite</h4></div></div></div><p>Usage of value objects is one of the most ignored and best return-on-investment the programmer can do. Values are
immutable and can be compared by value instead of memory reference. Concurrency is suddenly not an issue, since either
the value exists or it doesnât, no need for synchronization. Values are typically very easy to test and very robust to
refactoring.</p><p>Qi4j defines values as a primary meta type through the ValueComposite, as we think the benefits of values are great.
The ValueComposite is very light-weight compared to the EntityComposite, and its value can still be persisted as part
of an EntityComposite via a Property.</p><p>The characteristics of a ValueComposite compared to other Composite meta types are;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
It is Immutable.
</li><li class="listitem">
Its equals/hashCode works on the values of the ValueComposite.
</li><li class="listitem">
Can be used as Property types, but will not be indexed and searchable.
</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Service Composite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-service"></a>Service Composite</h4></div></div></div><p>Any service added, via the ModuleAssembly.addServices(), ModuleAssembly.services() and ModuleAssembly.importServices()
methods, will have the ServiceComposite meta type added to it. In Qi4j, when we speak of <span class="emphasis"><em>Services</em></span> we mean instances
of <span class="emphasis"><em>ServiceComposite</em></span>.</p><p>Most programmers are familiar with the term "Service", and after the failure of Object Oriented Programmingâs promise
to encapsulate all the behavior together with the objectâs state, programmers learned that the only way to deal with
decoupling and re-use was to make the objects into data containers and deploy services that acted upon those data
containers. Very much what functions did on structs back in the C and Pascal days.</p><p>Qi4j will bring a lot of the behavior back to the Composite itself, but we still need Services for cross-composite
functionality. The Qi4j Service model is fairly simple, yet powerful and flexible enough to accommodate most
service-oriented patterns and ability to integrate well with external systems whether they are in-JVM or remote,
such as Spring, OSGi, WS-*, Rest and others.</p><p>The characteristics of a ServiceComposite compared to other Composite meta types are;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
It is one singleton per declaration in bootstrap.
</li><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Services</em></span> in Qi4j are <span class="emphasis"><em>singletons</em></span>, one instance per definition. That means that there may exist multiple instances
of the same service type, but they can not be created on the fly in runtime, but has to be explicitly defined during
<a class="xref" href="core-bootstrap-assembly.html" title="Core Bootstrap">Assembly</a>.</p><p>By default, <span class="emphasis"><em>Services</em></span> are not instantiated until they are used. This means that the <span class="emphasis"><em>ServiceComposite</em></span> instance itself
will not exist until someone calls a method. If a <span class="emphasis"><em>Service</em></span> needs to be instantiated when the <span class="emphasis"><em>Module</em></span> is activated, one
need to declare/call the instantiateOnStartup() method on the <span class="emphasis"><em>ServiceDescriptor</em></span> during the bootstrap.</p><div class="section" title="Service Configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_service_configuration"></a>Service Configuration</h5></div></div></div><p>The configuration for a service is well supported in Qi4j.

by calling instantiateOnStartup(), this way;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@Override

{
    ServiceDeclaration service = module.addServices( MyDemoService.class );
    service.instantiateOnStartup();
</pre><p>If this method is not called during assembly, the activation will occur on first service usage.</p><p>Passivation occurs when a <a class="xref" href="_core.html#core-api-module" title="Module">Module</a> is deactivated, typically because the whole application is shutting down.
Passivation occurs in the reverse order of the activation, to ensure that dependent services are still available for a
passivating service.</p><p>Activators assembled with the service will get their beforeActivation and afterActivation methods called around the
ServiceComposite activation and their beforePassivation and afterPassivation around the ServiceComposite passivation.
Member injection and constructor initialization occur during the activation. The ServiceComposite can be used from the
afterActivation to the beforePassivation method.</p></div><div class="section" title="Identity and Tags"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_identity_and_tags"></a>Identity and Tags</h5></div></div></div><p>Services has an Identity, which drives the <a class="xref" href="_core.html#core-api-service-configuration" title="Service Configuration">Service Configuration</a> system and can be used to lookup a particular service
instance. Services can also be arbitrarily tagged, via the ServiceDescriptor. Example;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@Override

    ServiceDeclaration service = module.addServices( MyDemoService.class );
      [...snip...]

</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Service Configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-service-configuration"></a>Service Configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>Configuration in Qi4j is for Qi4j <a class="xref" href="_core.html#core-api-service" title="Service Composite">ServiceComposite</a> only. The Configuration is stored in a visible Entity
Store and is therefor runtime modifiable and not static in properties or XML files as in most other dependency
injection frameworks.</p><p>The Configuration system itself will handle all the details with interfacing with reading and writing the configuration.
The normal UnitOfWork management is used, but handled internally by the configuration system.</p><p>In Qi4j, Configuration are strongly typed and refactoring-friendly. Configuration is read from the entity store, but if
it can not be found, then it will try to bootstrap it from a properties file, with the same name as the
ServiceDescriptor.identifiedBy(), which is set during <a class="xref" href="core-bootstrap-assembly.html" title="Core Bootstrap">Assembly</a> and defaults to the fully qualified
classname of the <a class="xref" href="_core.html#core-api-service" title="Service Composite">ServiceComposite</a> type.</p><div class="section" title="Defining a Configuration Type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_defining_a_configuration_type"></a>Defining a Configuration Type</h5></div></div></div><p>The Configuration type is simply listing the properties that are available. The standard rules on @UseDefaults and
@Optional applies.
Example;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">public interface MailServiceConfiguration extends ConfigurationComposite
{
    Property&lt;String&gt; hostName();

    Property&lt;Integer&gt; port();
}
</pre></div><div class="section" title="Using a Configuration Type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_using_a_configuration_type"></a>Using a Configuration Type</h5></div></div></div><p>It is important to remember that Configuration is not static values that are set prior to application start-up and
therefor applications should not cache the values retrieved forever, but consciously know when the configuration should
be re-read.</p><p>Configuration is injected via the @This injection scope. One reasonable strategy is to read the configuration on service
activation, so by deactivating/reactivating a service, the user have a well-defined behavior to know how configuration
changes take effect. Example;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@This
private Configuration&lt;MailServiceConfiguration&gt; config;

@Override
public void sendMail( @Email String to, @MinLength( 8 ) String subject, String body )
{
    config.refresh();

</pre></div><div class="section" title="Modifying Configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_modifying_configuration"></a>Modifying Configuration</h5></div></div></div><p>Configuration is modifiable, and after the modifications have been made, the save() method on the Configuration type

}
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="EntityComposite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-entity"></a>EntityComposite</h4></div></div></div><p>Entities are common in the object oriented programming world, but has never reached the stardom of Class and Object.
Instead we have seen many attempts at creating Entities on top of Java, such as EJB (3 incompatible versions), Java
Data Objects (JDO, 2 somewhat compatible versions), Java Persistence Architecture (JPA, 2 somewhat compatible versions),
Hibernate (4+ somewhat incompatible versions) and many other less known. This seems to suggest that the topic of
creating objects that survives over long periods of time is a difficult one.</p><p>Eric Evans points out in his book that Entities is a very definite and distinct concept that needs to be handled
explicitly. Composite Oriented Programming in general, and Qi4j in particular, takes this point very seriously and
makes Entities a central part of the whole system. And likewise, we are convinced that it is not possible to develop
domain-knowledge-rich applications without a conscious and well-defined strategy on Entities. So, instead of spending
endless hours trying to get Hibernate mapping to do the right thing, we introduce a Composite meta type called
EntityComposite, which all entities must derive from, and by doing so automatically become persistable, searchable,
have a lifecycle and support nested undoable modifications.</p><p>The characteristics of an EntityComposite compared to other Composite meta types are;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
It has an Identity.
</li><li class="listitem">
It has a LifeCycle.
</li><li class="listitem">
It is typically persisted.
</li><li class="listitem">
It can only be referenced by an Association or ManyAssociation.
</li><li class="listitem">
Its CRUD operations are bound by a UnitOfWork.
</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="TransientComposite"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-transient"></a>TransientComposite</h4></div></div></div><p>TransientComposite is a Composite meta type for all other cases. The main characteristics are;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
It can not be serialized nor persisted.
</li><li class="listitem">
hashcode/equals are not treated specially and will be delegated to fragment(s) implementing those methods.
</li><li class="listitem">
It can not be used as a Property type.
</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Mixin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-mixin"></a>Mixin</h4></div></div></div><p>Mixins are the state-carrying part of a Composite instance. The other Fragments can not retain state between method
invocations as they are shared across Composite instances.</p><div class="section" title="Mixin Type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_mixin_type"></a>Mixin Type</h5></div></div></div><p>The Mixin Type is the interface that declares the Mixin methods. Each Mixin implementation (the classes defined in
the @Mixins annotation of a Composite declaration) implements one or more methods from one or more Mixin Types.</p><p>Mixin Type can be very simple, like;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">public interface BankAccount
{
    Money checkBalance();
}
</pre><p>Or contain hundreds of methods, subclassed from dozens of super interfaces.</p><p>The Mixin Types of a Composite are ;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
all the aggregated interfaces of the Composite Type, minus Composite meta-type interfaces, and
</li><li class="listitem">
all private mixin referenced types.
</li></ul></div><p>There is not a 1:1 correlation between Mixin Type and Mixin implementation. One canât even know if there are more or
less of one over the other. That is because a Mixin implementation can implement less than one, one, or more than one
Mixin Type.</p><p>It is also entirely possible that multiple implementation methods exists for a Mixin Type method. The mixin method
resolution algorithm will provide a deterministic behavior of which implementation of a method is chosen. The algorithm
is as follows;</p><p>For each declared method of all Mixin Types of a Composite;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
Iterate all Mixin types declared from left to right in the declaration,
</li><li class="listitem">
Iterate all Mixin types of super-interfaces from left to right in the <span class="emphasis"><em>extends</em></span> clause,
</li><li class="listitem">
Iterate all Mixin types within one interface before succeeding to the next interface,
</li><li class="listitem">
Iterate all super-interface Mixin types before proceeding to the super-interfaces of those,
</li><li class="listitem">
Iterate all Typed Mixin implementations of all super-interfaces, before repeating the algorithm for Generic Mixin
      implementations,
</li></ul></div><p>This means that one Mixin implementation can <span class="emphasis"><em>override</em></span> a single method that a larger mixin implementation implements
together with many other methods. So, just because a mixin implements MixinTypeA.method1() and has an implementation
of MixinTypeA.method2(), doesnât mean that method2() is mapped to that mixin. This is very important to remember. The
Envisage tool is capable of visualizing how Mixin Type methods are mapped to implementations.</p></div><div class="section" title="Public Mixins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_public_mixins"></a>Public Mixins</h5></div></div></div><p>Mixins are the state holders of the composite instance. Public Mixins are the mixins that are exposed to the outside

    }
}
</pre><p>In the above sample, the SomethingMixin will be made part of the Something composite.</p><p>If we have many interfaces defining many methods, that all must be backed by a mixin implementation, we simply list all
the mixins required.</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@Mixins( { StartMixin.class, VehicleMixin.class } )

        implements SpeedLocation
{
    // state for speed

    public void accelerate( float acceleration )
    {
        // logic
    }
}

</pre><p>Above the SpeedMixin only implements the accelerate() method, and Qi4j will only map that method to this mixin. The
other method of the SpeedLocation interface is not satisfied as the example is written and will generate a runtime
exception.</p></div><div class="section" title="Private Mixins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_private_mixins"></a>Private Mixins</h5></div></div></div><p>Public mixins expose their methods in the composite interface, and this is not always desirable. Qi4j supports
<span class="emphasis"><em>Private Mixins</em></span>, which are only visible within the composite itself. That means that other fragments in the composite
can see/use it, but it is not visible to the clients of the composite.</p><p>Private Mixins are handled automatically. When Qi4j detects a @This annotation referring to a type that is not defined
in the Composite interface, then that is a Private Mixin. The Mixin implementation class, however, must exist in the
list of Mixins in the @Mixins annotation. But often, the Private Mixin only list internal Property methods in the Mixin
Type, which will be satisfied by the standard PropertyMixin and hence always available.</p><p>This is particularly useful in Domain Driven Design, where you only want to expose domain methods, which are defined by
the context where they are used. But the state of the Mixin should not be exposed out at all. For instance, if we have
the Cargo interface like;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@Mixins( CargoMixin.class )
public interface Cargo extends EntityComposite
{
    String origin();

    String destination();

    void changeDestination( String newDestination );

}

</pre><p>The interface is defined by its context, and not really exposing the internal state. So in the implementation we
probably do something like;</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">public abstract class CargoMixin
        implements Cargo
{
    @This
    private CargoState state;

    public String origin()
    {
        return state.origin().get();
    }

    public String destination()
    {
        return state.destination().get();
    }

    public void changeDestination( String newDestination )
    {
        state.destination().set( newDestination );
    }
}

</pre><pre class="programlisting brush: java">public interface CargoState
{
    Property&lt;String&gt; origin();
    Property&lt;String&gt; destination();
}

</pre><p>So, in this typical case, we donât need to declare the Mixin for the CargoState, as it only defines Property methods,
which are handled by the standard PropertyMixin always present.</p></div><div class="section" title="Typed Mixin vs Generic Mixin implementations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_typed_mixin_vs_generic_mixin_implementations"></a>Typed Mixin vs Generic Mixin implementations</h5></div></div></div><p>Mixins, Concerns and SideEffects can either be "typed" or "generic". A Typed Mixin implementation implements one or
more Mixin Type interfaces, and one or more of the methods of those interfaces. A Generic Mixin implementation
implements java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler, and can therefor be matched to any method of any interface.
Typically, AppliesTo annotation is used to filter the methods that such Generic Mixin implementation is mapped against,
and sometimes Generic Mixin implementations are "last resort".</p><p>Experience shows that Generic Mixin implementations are rare, and should only be used in extreme cases. They are
less frequent than Generic Concern or Generic SideEffect implementations, but inside the Qi4j API are a couple of
Generic Mixin implementations that are always present to make the life of the developer easier, such as PropertyMixin,
AssociationMixin, ManyAssociationMixin, NoopMixin. The first 3 are declared on the Composite and EntityComposite
interfaces and automatically included if needed. They also serve as excellent example of what they can be used for.</p><pre class="programlisting brush: java">@AppliesTo( { PropertyMixin.PropertyFilter.class } )
public final class PropertyMixin
    implements InvocationHandler
{
    @State private StateHolder state;

    public Object invoke( Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args )
        throws Throwable
    {
        return state.getProperty( method );
    }

                                  Class&lt;?&gt; modifierClass )
        {
            return Property.class.isAssignableFrom( method.getReturnType() );
        }
    }
}</pre><p>Other examples that we have come across;</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
Mapping from Property&lt;type&gt; to POJO style "properties".
</li><li class="listitem">
Remote Service delegation.
</li><li class="listitem">
Scripting delegation, where a script will implement the Mixin Type.
</li></ul></div><p>which seems to indicate that Generic Mixin implementations are likely to be used in integration of other technologies.</p><p>Typed Mixin implementations are much preferred in general business logic, as they will be first-class citizens of
the IDE as well, for navigation, find usage, refactoring and many other common tasks. This is one of the main
advantages of the Qi4j way of doing AOP compared to AspectJ et al, where "weaving" is something bolted onto an
applicationâs classes via regular expressions and known naming conventions, which can change in an instance by a
developer being unaware of which PointCuts applies to his code.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Concern"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="core-api-concern"></a>Concern</h4></div></div></div><p>Concerns are the equivalent of "around advice" in Aspect Oriented Programming. They are chained into an invocation
stack for each Mixin Type method and invoked after the Constraints have been executed. Since they are sitting "around"
the Mixin implementation method, they also have a chance to modify the returned result, and even skip calling the
underlying Mixin method implementation altogether.</p><p>To create a concern, you need to create a class that,</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">

## DDD support in Qi4j explained

Domain Driven Design has a special status in Qi4j, and its tactical bits are embraced in Qi4j itself. These includes Entities, Services and Values. In Rickardâ€™s blog entry [Qi4j and state modeling](http://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/qi4j_and_state_modeling), he covers these topics in a relatively easy to understand and pedagogic format. A highly recommended read for people who want to get a quick overview of what Qi4j is really about.

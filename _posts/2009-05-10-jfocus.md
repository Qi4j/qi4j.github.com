## Qi4j @ JFocus 2009 - COP / DDD

At JFokus earlier this year Rickard Öberg was interviewed by Dan Bergh Johnsson about Composite Oriented Programming and Qi4j.

The interview covers some of the rationale behind Composite Oriented Programming and the Qi4j project, its focus on DDD and why Java was chosen as language for the implementation. You can see the interview online on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcJqcJND42s).

## Qi4j @ JFokus 2012 - ReST

Implementing a REST API today is important in many cases, both as an integration point to your application and as a way for clients to access the application. But there are few frameworks out there that help you fulfil all the constraints of REST, and therefore only makes your API a REST-wannabe. The idiom thatâ€™s often missing is HATEOAS. This session will look at how you can build a ReSTful api and applying HATEOAS. The background of this session is the Qi4j at JavaZone 2010 - ReST/DCI presentation.

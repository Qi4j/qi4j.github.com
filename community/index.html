        <h2>What does this really mean?</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, we work together to achieve the visions of Qi4j, based on technical merits alone in an open and
            friendly manner, mostly via qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups.. It means that everyone in the community are stake
            holders in the resulting codebase, and noone can claim it is mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, all source code, artwork and documentation produced in Qi4j are licensed very liberally under the Apache
            License ver 2.0. This allows you to use our efforts in your own projects, whether they are open sourced, commercial
            or any other arrangement you like, subject to a few terms like "Must re-distribute a Notice that your product
            contains Qi4j" and such. See the License text for exact details, and please consult with IP rights lawyers about
            this and other Open Source licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirdly, Qi4j invites everyone to participate. There are many ways to participate, not only by writing code. See
            list in the <a href="participate.html">Participation</a> section.

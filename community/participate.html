        <p>
            The Qi4j community is an open source community centered around software and components for Composite Oriented
            Programming on Java/Scala, and related design methodologies that are enhanced by using Qi4j, like Domain Driven
            Design, DCI (Data, Context, Interaction) and HATEOAS REST.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Qi4j community is an open community, in so far as it welcomes any member that accepts the basic criteria of
            contribution and adheres to the community's Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can contribute to Qi4j also by contributing documentation or giving feedback on the current documentation.
            Basically, at all the places where you can get help, there's also room for contributions.

            <p>
                To discuss with the Qi4j community, it is easiest to do so at the
                <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/qi4j-dev">qi4j-dev</a> Google group. This forum is open
                to everyone and regular open source forum etiquette applies. Failure to be respectful may cause the poster to be
                expelled. The forum is a light and friendly one, where we are all friends working on a marvelous way of writing Java
                code.

        <h2>Principles of Participation <small>(not enforced yet)</small></h2>
        <p>
            We borrow a lot of our principles in community building from OPS4J, which also provides us with the infrastructure
            needs we have for the time being. OPS4J is unique that it allows everyone to participate and modify the codebase
            without being voted into the community, like Apache and other communities. We want the spirit of this, but we are a bit
            nervous that Qi4j will be too successful and too many people want to modify the core pieces and some will spoil more
            than progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have therefor concluded that we will, at least initially, confine the Qi4j Core to entrusted members of the
            community only, whereas everyone is free to participate in the many other sub-projects, such as extensions, libraries
            and integration solutions. By the introduction of Git, it is now much easier for people to work on any part of the
            system, even if they have no official commit rights and allow people to review the work, then commit it and the right
            person gets the credit.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Dev Team</h2>
        <p>
            The Core team are the Stewards and Guardians of the overall project. They ensure that all pieces of Qi4j are in good
            standing and assist in all matters of the project. Only the Core Team will modify the official Qi4j Core repository.
        </p>

        <h2>Platform Team</h2>
        <p>
            The Platform team are the work horses of the project, and are adding a lot of value to our libraries and extensions.
            These two repositories are where the bulk of the valuable code will eventually reside. The Platform Team consists of
            people who are showing dedication to the project.
        </p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
            All remaining areas are open to anyone who ask (politely). Send GitHub ID to qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups together
            with an introduction of yourself.
        </p>

        <h2>Additionally</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub's community features should not be understated. You are encouraged to clone our repostories, work on your own
            features and do pull requests for Core and Platform teams to pick up. It is wise to send a message to
            qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups before issuing a pull request along with an explanation of what the patch is for and
            the rationale behind it.

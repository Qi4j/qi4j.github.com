    <h1>Playing field</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Qi4j is a collaborative effort of open development, and we need to have some rules in place to make that work.
        <br/>
        Below is an evolving list of rules and guidelines that we try to follow.
    </p>

        <h2>Coding Standard</h2>
        <p>
            The coding standard at Qi4j promotes whitespace to aid in reading the code. Opening braces are placed on new lines,
            spaces are between operators and so forth. We are following the OPS4J coding standards, as they have IDEA, Eclipse and
            Checkstyle templates prepared or in the works. These are slowly evolving, and it is likely we will evolve with them.
            The coding standards can be found in
            <a href="https://scm.ops4j.org/repos/ops4j/projects/community/resources/">https://scm.ops4j.org/repos/ops4j/projects/community/resources/</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Design and Implementation work</h2>
        <p>
            We want all discussions around the design and implementation to happen on the Google Group qi4j-dev.
            But we also recognize that instant messaging, voice and face-2-face are important tools to
            increase productivity. The participants are expected to convey in a comprehensible format (not just a copy/paste of
            the IM log) any new development, ideas and progress that occur during those sessions. The decisions for any multiple
            choices should be made on the qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups only.
        </p>

        <h2>Committers</h2>
        <p>
            The term "committer" is often used in open development efforts, and in Qi4j it refers to the individuals who has commit
            rights to a particular part of the codebase. Some areas in Qi4j codebase are open to everyone, others are based on
            meritocracy where individuals who has been contributing to the subproject are invited by the existing committers.
            People who has not contributed to a subproject over the last 12 months are no longer considered committers, although
            the commit rights will not be revoked. Note that "rights" in this context is a social contract, as no ACL is in place
            to stop a Community member to mess up the Qi4j Core. It is mostly a matter of loss of reputation at stake, since
            it is easy to revert these and if found to be malicious the member will have all commit rights revoked.
        </p>

        <h2>Votes on releases</h2>
        <p>
            All committers agree that all releases should be voted upon before the release is made. Releases should happen early
            and often, to shorten the feedback loop. All committers of the subproject being released has a binding vote. Everyone
            else has a vote of recommendation. Releases can be vetoed for two reasons; Incompatibility and Legal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Incompatibility is not a reason within the 0.x series and not a reason between major versions, such as 1.3 -> 2.0.
        </p>

        <h2>Reverts of commits</h2>
        <p>
            There are cases when we need to revert commits made by people. Common sense should rule, but the above cases of
            incompatibility and legal reasons are two obvious examples. Sabotage, misunderstandings and mistakes are others.
            When such cause arises, the issue should be brought to the qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups, explained why the commit
            should be reverted, and if noone objects within 48 hours, the commit can be reverted. If the concern results in a
            debate, then the issue is resolved in a simple majority vote among the committers.
        </p>

        <h2>Infrastructure issues</h2>
        <p>
            Any infrastructure requests or problems, should be directed to qi4j-dev forum at Google Groups.
        </p>

        <h2>Trademarks, Patents and Licenses</h2>
        <p>
            Qi4J is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0. All committers agree that all their contributions are licensed
            under this license to Qi4j, other committers and the general public. The Copyright of each contribution is held by the
            contributor, and no Copyright assigns are required.
        </p>
        <p>
            All committers assert that no patents are hidden within their contributions or that if such patent exists then such
            patent is freely licensed to Qi4j, other committers and the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
            All contributors agree that the Qi4j project may change to a later version of the Apache License, if/when such license
            becomes available and the Core Dev Team at that time finds it appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Qi4j" is a trademark of the Qi4j Community, Niclas Hedhman, Rickard &Ouml;berg, and all copyright owners of the Qi4j
            codebase. If Qi4j is registered as a trademark, then that person/entity agrees that such registration is to the benefit
            of the Qi4j Community and all copyright owners of the Qi4j codebase, and only acts as an agent on their behalf. Failure
            to do so, the registrant looses the right to participate in the Qi4j effort, and potentially face legal actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Qi4j is a community effort and is currently no organization. This may change into a non-profit, membership organization
            at some later point in time.

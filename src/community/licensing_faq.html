            <strong>Q</strong>: Can I use Qi4j Core in my commercial applications under a closed-source, proprietary license?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>A</strong>: Yes. The Apache License is very business-friendly. Please observe the obligations on your part,
                especially regarding notices, trademarks and patent licensing terms.

            <strong>Q</strong>: My company has invested a lot of time to learn and understand the Qi4j platform, and we think we
            are really good at writing Qi4j applications and would like to start training others. Can we advertise that we are
            "Qi4j experts" or that we conduct "Advanced Qi4j training"?
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <strong>A</strong>: Yes, the "fair use" license to the Qi4j trademarks allows third-party to use the Qi4j marks in
                such manner. If in doubt, contact the Qi4j Community.
